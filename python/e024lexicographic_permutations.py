Project Euler #24: Lexicographic Permutations

From the description:
    "A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. . . . If all of the
    permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it
    lexicographic order.

    What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
    5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?"
